hey guys today I really want to focus on and talk about - tell me about yourself question I want to focus on helping people answer these tricky questions and as you'll see in all other videos this question is tricky because it's open-ended and answering open-ended questions it's another video will discuss how to specifically answer these types of questions and how you really navigate the space but for the tell me about yourself question there is so much information out there on YouTube the challenge with the advice is that it assumes that you know what your audience wants to hear and in reality you don't you know we're assuming that every interviewer is going to show up engaged excited that they're always having a great day and this isn't always true so you really need to know your audience and and study the room this goes back to the mirroring concept that we've talked about if you haven't seen that you can go back on YouTube and watch that other video that I've posted but the best way that you can handle this question is to take control and that's really what the entire interview is about putting the control in your hands not in the interviewers hands because they have a distinct advantage over you so start hedging that towards towards yourself in your direction okay these are the things that the company needs but things change they might have posted that job a month ago two months ago the hiring manager may have changed priorities might have drastically changed they might have a new product line they might be getting rid of a different product line they might be growing into a different space and so while you see the core fundamentals of what they're looking for in the job description you don't know what's been happening internally in the organization and this is really your opportunity to take control and get in the right space and ask the right questions so if somebody asked me that tell me about yourself question what I do is I essentially say sue it's obviously a great question a question I'm familiar with and what I can tell you is my core my three core skill key skills and strengths are a B and C now based on what I've read from your company you know what's happening in the news and the job description I think that my core skills these specific core three skills really align well with the role but as you think about the role today your current company needs if we're talking about a B and C is there one that you prefer for me to focus on than another because I want to make sure that I'm giving you insight into me that helps and you figure out whether I'm the right person for the role wow that's crazy in kind of throwing it back to them and and Sue might say you know what Jeff no I'd love to hear about your key strengths and how they align with the position but sometimes maybe it's 25% maybe it's 30 percent of the time Sue's gonna say you know what I really want you to focus on B because b seems to be where we're having a challenge in finding the right candidate B seems to be our current company's priority do you understand how important it is that just by asking that simple question you've achieved something that very few candidates will achieve which is really asking the interviewer what they want to hear when the interviewer tells you what they want to hear you tell it to them it may be a little bit tricky for some people to respond to a question with a question and I think that that's what's lacking in the other YouTube videos is there's a sulcus assumptive 'no sub static and there's nothing static in corporate America things are always moving changing and also the interviewer if they come in they're having a bad day they're not engage they're not excited if you throw them right back into the conversation within 15 to 20 seconds of answering that question you've brought them up you've kind of put them in that space where they're like oh my goodness this is somebody who's gonna engage and not just give me this crafted catered answer that they've practiced over and over again right don't go back through your career and tell them about all that stuff don't talk about your personal stuff focus in on your core skills and how they align to the role and then see if there's a core skill set that they can derive from that list of three that's really gonna match for their current position and current needs again this strategy isn't for everybody but if you get comfortable and answering this type of question in this type of space your success is gonna be crazy because you're just you're really thinking about the role the position and how your skills align so whether you get that question or not thinking in that space will help you have success so I've really hope that this helps in the comments below please let me know if you have any questions and and always if there's other content other questions that you'd love to have me explain how to answer and in the best way that I know how please let me know again my name is Jeff thanks so much
